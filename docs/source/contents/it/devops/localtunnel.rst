LocalTunnel
===========

LocalTunnel is a tool that allows you to expose your local web servers to the internet. It's particularly useful for testing and sharing web applications during development. Here's how you can use it:

Installation
------------

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

To install LocalTunnel globally, open your terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install -g localtunnel

Usage
-----

Once LocalTunnel is installed, you can start using it with the following steps:

1. Start your local web server on a specific port. For example, to run a web server on port 3000, you might use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ node server.js

2. Now, to expose this local server to the internet, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lt --port 3000 --subdomain example

   Replace '3000' with the port your web server is running on and 'devbox-ubuntu2004' with your desired subdomain.

3. LocalTunnel will generate a public URL for your local server, which you can access in your web browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    https://example.loca.lt/

   This URL allows others to access your local web server temporarily.

That's it! You've successfully exposed your local web server to the internet using LocalTunnel. Remember that these tunnels are temporary and will close after some time.

For more options and advanced usage, you can refer to the official LocalTunnel documentation: `LocalTunnel Documentation <https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel>`_.
